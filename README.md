# OpenAI Chatbot

This is a Python project that uses the OpenAI API and Gradio to create a chatbot interface that can converse with users. The chatbot uses the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to generate responses to user input.

## Getting Started

To get started with the chatbot, you'll need to do the following:

1. Sign up for an OpenAI API key at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
3. Open the `chatbot.py` file in a Python editor or IDE.
4. Replace the `config.OPENAI_API_KEY` value with your own OpenAI API key.
5. Run the `chatbot.py` file.

The chatbot interface will open in a new window, where you can start typing messages to converse with the chatbot.

## How it Works

The chatbot interface is created using the `gradio` Python package, which provides an easy way to create web-based user interfaces for machine learning models. The chatbot uses the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to generate responses to user input.

The `chatbot.py` file contains the Python code for the chatbot. The `generate_response` function takes a prompt as input and generates a response using the GPT-3 model. The `chatbot_interface` function takes user input as input and generates a response using the `generate_response` function. The function keeps track of the conversation history in the `history` variable, which is stored as a list of messages. The history is combined into a single string and returned as the output.

## Customizing the Chatbot

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the following variables in the `chatbot.py` file:

- `model_engine`: Specifies which GPT-3 model to use. By default, it is set to "text-davinci-002", which is one of the most powerful GPT-3 models available.
- `max_tokens`: Controls the length of the response generated by the GPT-3 model.
- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the response generated by the GPT-3 model.

You can also modify the Gradio interface by changing the input and output fields, adding additional parameters to the `gr.Interface` function, and modifying the HTML/CSS of the interface.
